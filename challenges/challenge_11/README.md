# Qwerty Words

A regular qwerty-style keyboard has three rows of keys with these letters:

```
row 1: qwertyuiop
row 2: asdfghjkl
row 3: zxcvbnm
```

Define a **qwerty word** to be a word whose letters all come from the same
row. For example, *twitter* is a qwerty word because it consists of letters
just from row 1, and *flags* is a qwerty word because it consists of letters
just from row 2. However, *gap* is not a qwerty word, since it has letters
from rows 1 and 2.

How many qwerty words are in [word11.txt](word11.txt)?

- Another keyboard layout is
  [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout). If a
  **Dvorak word** is defined to be a word whose letters come from one row of a
  [Dvorak keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout), how
  many Dvorak words are in [word11.txt](word11.txt)?

- If you want to maximize the number of words that can be typed on one row of
  a keyboard, how would you arrange the letters into three rows?
