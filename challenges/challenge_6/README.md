# Letter Count

Suppose you count the number of occurrences of just the 26 lower case
alphabetic letters *a*, *b*, ... ,*z* in [words6.txt](words6.txt). What is
the:

1. *least* frequently occurring letter, and how many times does it occur?

2. *most* frequently occurring letter, and how many times does it occur?


## Files

[words6.txt](words6.txt).

Write your answer in [challenge_6.cpp](challenge_6.cpp).


## Extra

The following are some related ideas that you might want to think about. They
are not for marks!

- How would you change your program to count both lowercase and uppercase
  letters?

- How would you change your program to count an arbitrary subset of given
  characters (instead of a range of characters)?


## Reminder

The purpose of these challenges is to practice solving problems with C++.
Please try to do them on your own, and don't just search for solutions online
or ask others for the answers.
