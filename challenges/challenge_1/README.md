# Sum of Three

## Instructions

How many sets of exactly three different numbers in
[numbers1.txt](numbers1.txt) sum to 12345?

The order of the numbers in a set *doesn't* matter. For example, how many sets
of three different numbers from this list sum to 15?

```
4
1
2
9
3
6
11
```

The answer is two: {2,4,9} and {1,3,11}.


## Files

[numbers1.txt](numbers1.txt) contains one positive integer per line.

Write your answer in [challenge_1.cpp](challenge_1.cpp).


## Extra

- How hard would it be to modify your program to find three different numbers
  that sum to a value other than 12345?

- How would your program change if duplicate numbers were allowed?

## Reminder

The purpose of these challenges is to practice solving problems with C++.
Please try to do them on your own, and don't just search for solutions online
or ask others for the answers.
